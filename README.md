_**Assignment 1: Walk-In Clinic Simulator**_
- Simulates a walk-in clinic data interface, using a data type called Patient. Written using a position-oriented List ADT, this program has the ability to add, remove, return, search, and print the contents of this database.

_**Assignment 3: Translated Dictionary**_
- This program reads in a user text file, storing it in a data type called Word Pair. The dictionary, written using a binary search tree, can return, search, and print its contents in alphabetical order. 

_**Assignment 4: Walk in Bank Simulator**_

- This program simulates a walk-in lineup at a bank from a user text file. Utilizes both priority queue (implemented using a minimum binary heap) and expandable circular queue data structures. This program organizes customers by their unique event types (arrival or departure) and the times in which they arrive and leave.
