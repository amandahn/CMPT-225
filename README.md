_**Assignment: Walk in Bank Simulator**_

- A program which simulates a walk-in lineup at a bank from a text file of information given by the user. Utilizes both priority queue (implemented using a minimum binary heap) and expandable circular queue data structures. This program organizes customers by their unique event types (arrival or departure, a special object created for this simulation) and the times in which they arrive and leave.
